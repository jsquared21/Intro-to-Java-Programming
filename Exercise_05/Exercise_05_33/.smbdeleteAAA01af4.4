/*
(Perfect number) A positive integer is called a perfect number if it is equal to
the sum of all of its positive divisors, excluding itself. For example, 6 is the first
perfect number because 6 = 3 + 2 + 1. The next is 28 = 14 + 7 + 4 + 2
+ 1. There are four perfect numbers less than 10,000. Write a program to find all
these four numbers.
