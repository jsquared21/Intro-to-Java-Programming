/*
(Compute the greatest common divisor) Another solution for Listing 5.9 to find
the greatest common divisor of two integers n1 and n2 is as follows: First find d
to be the minimum of n1 and n2, then check whether d, d-1, d-2, . . . , 2, or 1 is
a divisor for both n1 and n2 in this order. The first such common divisor is the
greatest common divisor for n1 and n2. Write a program that prompts the user to
enter two positive integers and displays the gcd.
