* (Points nearest to each other) Listing 8.3 gives a program that finds two      *
* points in a two-dimensional space nearest to each other. Revise the program so *
* that it finds two points in a three-dimensional space nearest to each other.   *
* Use a two-dimensional array to represent the points. Test the program using    *
* the following points:                                                          *
* double[][] points = {{-1, 0, 3}, {-1, -1, -1}, {4, 1, 1},                      *
* {2, 0.5, 9}, {3.5, 2, -1}, {3, 1.5, 3}, {-1.5, 4, 2},                          *
* {5.5, 4, -0.5}};                                                               *
* The formula for computing the distance between two points (x1, y1, z1) and     *
* (x2, y2, z2) is 2(x2 - x1)2 + (y2 - y1)2 + (z2 - z1)2.                         *
